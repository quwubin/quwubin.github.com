1.  Focus on the biological problem
2.  Choose a programming language which can relieve you from the coding level
3.  Logic – beyond the code
4.  KISS – Keep It Simple and Stupid
5.  The code is for human first, machine second (Keep the code readable)
6.  Don't backup is evil (Github, BitBucket)
7.  Share your code if you want to improve yourself
8.  Follow the conventions (e.g. Python and Rails)
9.  Always tests
10. Practice, Practice, Practice (The 10000-Hours Rule)
