# About me

Wubin Qu, author of [MFEprimer](http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0/) and [MPprimer](http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/mprimer).

Focused on multiplex PCR primer design, especially for high-throughput, tiling, multiple targets enrichment for 2nd sequencing.

- high quality by checking specificity, dimers, hairpins, SNPs
- auto-group for tiling, incompatible primers and put them into different tubes
- virtual electrophoresis for low-throughput (usually < 20) multiplex PCR primer design if needed
- parallel for high-throughput primer design
